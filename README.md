This is a repo for reproducing the result of the paper Emergence of Shape Bias in Convolutional Neural Networks through Activation Sparsity.
We have recreated Figures 2 (texture-synthesis), 3 (reconstruction) and 5 (benchmarking) and have placed the associated code in the named directories.
The report is attached.
