This is a repo for reproducing the result of the paper Emergence of Shape Bias in Convolutional Neural Networks through Activation Sparsity.

We have recreated Figures 2 (texture-synthesis), 3 (reconstruction) and 5 (benchmarking) and have placed the associated code in the named directories.

## Figure 2

## Figure 3
To recreate figure 3, see the associated [Jupyter notebook](reconstruction/reconstruction.ipynb) and run the code. 

The resulting figures will be in the [results](reconstruction/results) directory, in all three shapes.

## Figure 5
